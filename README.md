# Welcome to the "Awesome" List of Acronyms

The acronyms I've compiled here are mostly around the areas of *business*, *technology* and *startup culture*.

This list is far from, nor will it ever be complete.  It's designed to be a living, evolving reference of terms that I occassional forget or have on-the-tip-of-my-tongue.

I can't make any attestament to their accuracy, context or proper usage.

Feel free to make additions, propose deletions or update existing.

The motivation for this list stems from a new job role that I've taken on and being back in an individual contributor role I've found myself searching for industry acronyms that haven't been part of my lexicon recently.

If you're a [CLI](#CLI) jockey like me, it's trivial to create a shell script or `grep` for a quick term breakdown.

This list is mostly unstructured at the moment but I'm open to recommendations via pull request or comment.  At this point, my best suggestion is to keep things alphabetized.  Maybe at some point we'll organize by category or something more suitable.
